## 🤹‍♂️ Fun Facts

- This is my **first ever web project** built fully with **HTML + CSS + JS**.
- I hand-coded every key like a proud musician tunes their piano. 🛠️🎼
- The hardest part? Making sure every note *sounds good* without waking the whole house.
- Total number of Ctrl+Z: probably more than the number of keys on a real Casio.

## 😂 What I Learned

- `position: absolute` has **trust issues**. It never stays where I expect it to.  
- CSS makes you feel powerful… until one `margin` breaks the entire layout.  
- JS event listeners are like clingy friends — always watching.  
- Sometimes fixing a bug just means deleting a line and pretending it was never there.  
- Turns out, making a keyboard is more fun than actually *learning* how to play one. 😅  
- But honestly, I learned **how to bring ideas to life** using nothing but HTML, CSS, and JS — and that’s kind of cool, right?
